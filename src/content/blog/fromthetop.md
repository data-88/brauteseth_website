The command came from the top. So to speak. Not through the normal envelopes with the red stamp. This came in a white envelope. Delivered by hand. It was a letter that raised eyebrows amongst the delivery corps. Don’t speculate. It won’t be a court martial. Those are green envelopes. Something more sinister like A post in Siberia.

Lieutenant Karl let the envelope sit on his desk for a moment. He thought of all the possibilities. It could be a promotion. There need not only be negative outcomes. He knew the seconds were ticking as orders since these would demand immediate action. Word has already returned that the letter has been delivered. Time felt thick and slow. He hesitated.

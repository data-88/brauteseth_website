We spent this weekend demolishing rusks, planning crazy roadtrips, reading psychology, running by the river, wine tasting and chicken roasting in this beautiful small village just past Hermanus. We’ve been wanting to stay there for ages and found an amazing cottage called Pizbrooke through @beatnikbazaar. Pizbrooke is an original Stanford Cottage built during the early 1900′s. You follow @StanfordVillage and some other Stanford locals: @beatnikbazaar, @StyleGuideCT and @guy_with_camera (hopefully one day). You can also see the cottage where we stayed on www.stanfordvillage.co.za. Can’t wait to go back.

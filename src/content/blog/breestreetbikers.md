you’re useless but comfortable. it’s like a childhood memory of being strapped to somebody’s back. I even took a nap. this is what I hear from my girlfriend after I had spent the day fighting a bonneville through a hell of water with her strapped on behind me. our friends dropped phrases like ‘very brave’ as we crept out of bree steet and into a storm from a greek myth. we had been planning this for weeks (down to redrawing the illustrator artwork 4 times) so we weren’t prepared to let the weather kill our party. it’s incredible how a storm can wash away your sense of aesthetics. by the afternoon, when we eventually arrived at groote post after 2 hours in a thunderstorm, we looked like large bin bags floating on wheels. gene was in a green onesie and you from miles away you could spot a straight line of luminousness cutting through swartland. I looked like a welder who had drowned while hanging off the side of the tableview seli1 wreck.

our new 3-headed snake logo fast became a zap sign. the over-zealous marketing types amongst us referred to it as trisector and wanted to commission brand values for each head but we found it was most useful as hand gesture. a entire range of rude meanings can be created by variations of three fingers pulled while passing and lauren took the time and effort to try out every one of them. the clouds decided to take a break and after stocking up on darling brew and boerewors we cruised through to riebeek kasteel to break it’s perfectly curated small-town silence with pokey guitar tunes and puns. jason + paul an der spuy = puns to the power of penis. church bells and over-eager roosters remind you on the hour of time passing without letting you use it for sleep. on sunday we swooped through to tulbagh for a late breakfast and spent the rest of the day in back-road biker heaven as we drifted through some of the most JPG-ready landscapes of the western cape.

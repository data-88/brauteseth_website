Emily wanted her content to go viral very badly. She didn’t have many followers on Instagram and didn’t want to seem too desperate by adding too many hashtags. Maybe this one will be her lucky post. The one that makes her into a influencer and she can quit her job as a junior copywriter and just travel. True luxury was experiences not things. She was at that life stage that she didn’t needed some sense of purpose cash.

Live authentically the caption read. The photo was looking out of a tent in Bali over a turquoise ocean. She had placed a small, overpriced gas stove with a coffee mug she got from Typo. A warm gradient and a positive vibe. Should she tag the camping brand she wonders. It would be great to have them as a client.

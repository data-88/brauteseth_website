Wherever there’s a human being and a cellphone there’s an opportunity to doomscroll. Watching the brand-new generation navigate real life interactions becomes a spectator sport. The generation brought into this era demonstrates resistance to AFS (away from screen) unless it’s able to be interpreted through likes and DMs. To which place do zombies go when we stare down into the endless mini television tunnel which from our pockets is manifested? Assuming the bent neck position is the product of the mental virus of feed refreshment. A mindless feast dipping through dreamlike states of unbeing. A chance for thumb-based tenosynovitis. Our eyes become dopamine-inducing zoom lenses leading to the outskirts of the universe. We thank you workhouse meme master for our daily bread but please sir, can I have some more? The mysterious gargoyle conjured from etherbits casts exacerbating spells freezing us into an infinite now. Wake up - eighty-four in bed - still scrolling. 

It’s an illness emboldened by our passion to consume. The attention economy is the claw in the brain. Holding it film. Don’t resist/can’t resist. As powerful as a pull from an illicit something legalized in 40 states for the youth. Losing prefrontal cortex performance after years of heavy usage floating in the interactive cumulonimbus. The withdrawal symptoms are not yet part of a peer-reviewed longitudinal study downloadable as a PDF. Our modern hero is a person immune to working for free as a data subject for Meta, ByteDance and YouTube. Analogue Moses leads us from unending shadows in the computerized rave cave. 

A totalitarianism coma thrives in the virtual petri dish. Like a wedding photograph, the moments are envisioned through performative actions where history is represented as soon as it forms. Life is a careful dramatization for an all-encompassing matrix of algorithms. Values are mediated through tech ballistics. Fear of missing out is constant and unwavering but with the internet wiring we can be partly satisfied by being simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. No matter how far you travel, the WiFi will be warm, welcoming and waiting. Our adverts reflect references common to gigabyte culture because the revolution will be Instagrammed. It’s fire in the hand.

Craft beer in Cape Town has become a matter of local pride. Brewers lined up at the 4th We Love Real Beer festival like proud dads at their kids first track and field day. Pouring samples like they would present small trophies. Well done. You’re here. This is going to be good. You deserve it. Craft Beer in Cape Town has interwoven a culture of cool woodstock converted grunge, side street cafe and design trend better than patterns in a plaid lumberjack shirt. It’s become a movement polished in a unique Cape Town way. Locals now know the difference between their lagers, their ales, their stouts, their weisses, pils and pales and they can often whip out a few foreign words if needed to win a brewing technique debate. Some guy even told me at the festival that he was a beer recipe designer which is something like climbing the last ridges of the summit of hipsterdom. It was great to see some African styles appearing in recipes like the Sowetan bolder palette. It’s the the kind of flavour that makes you start beaming at people and shaking hands with stranger. So what’s changed at the 4th real beer festival? It’s more relaxed, more organized and there was a lot more time to enjoy and space and experience before it gets crowded and rowdy as the biscuit mill slowly fills with thick folksy jangles and the fermenting fog of feel good.


Beer. That majestic social lubricator. Beer. That hoppy happiness by the draft which cools the throat and warms the heart. Beer. That magical love juice which turns the girlfriend into charming doter (a sharp Chenin Blanc having the opposite effect). Beer. The cause of cosy festival cultures dedicated to the cause of slugging more of the golden good stuff. After the huge success of the first RealBeer festival, the organizers went one step further. As usual a huge selection of local and small craft brewers and food stalls to support the taste indulgence. And this time there just seemed to have more space and more flow inside. It was #Realbeer Two Point O and the Biscuit Mill filled with chalkboards and flags and flowers in teapots and whitewashed tables overflowing with frothy interactions and beaming conversations. By the evening the sunlight started streaming through strategically poked gaps in the white rafters and the pink balloons turn to glowing moons, reflecting the warm mood of the beer touched congregation in a happy hubbub. We had started on the roasted Darling Brew and worked our way left for a second draft of Napier and so continued around the rabble until losing either the will or ability for rudimentary arithmetic. The twanky guitars showered the party with thick chinking riffs and merry meanings. You can’t really hear the lyrics. Not that it matters because the music is awesome and there’s a hot girl with a tambourine. Tecla’s still busy *lick*ing everything, “This is my mom. Sorry, she’s slightly drunk.”

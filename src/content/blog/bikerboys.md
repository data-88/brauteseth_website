petrol is unlike normal drugs. paired with speed it produces some strange side effects like turning men into boys before they can even get to 3rd gear. yesterday we spent the evening with a motley crew (my dad’s words) revving through the city streets on all sorts of mechanical animals. cafe racers, cut-backs, scooters and custom chopped skateboard-seaters chasing after speed demons of performance engineering. some guys were whooping like teenagers on facebook and overexicted engines started bursting and breaking. there’s a small custom biker subculture starting in cape town which circles around flatwhite fueling spots like the new deluxe in roodehek street and jason bakery on bree. there’s even a few custom bike shops opening like little churches in albert road and bree attended by the disciples of deus ex machina. all we need now is a biker gang name which somehow includes the words destruction, sex, burning hellfire and bree street.

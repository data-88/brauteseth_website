we live in an age of big data change in the cloud. the tipping point of the mashup revolution is a paradigm change in the knowledge economy driven by failfast engineers. theyâ€™re normally 1st generation immigrants in the valley creating scalable open graphs. this seismic shift in the local, so cal, solomo and solocalglocalmo ecologies in the EC2 is a crowdsourced immersion of lean enterprises in B2B and B2C. You could call it social engineering the freemium pipeline. these hyperlocal influencers are the holy grail of early adopters and this transmedia of user generated aggregation is a pivot of bookmarkable venture capitalism synergies. they cut a bleeding edge in smart phone penetration, early enterprises of minimal buyable products are now finally harnessing the network effects of semantic life hacks. thought leadership is how we cross the digital devide on a wave of nextgen wikiability and thats not just an app to tweet your cupcake.

it felt like half the cape town twitterati flocked to hemel en aarde this weekend for simons birthday. there’s never been a man so proud of a surfboard. it was an afternoon of boys being boys. girls being girls. jason chasing an angry ox and david building a fire big enough to braai it whole. the girl camp talks about contraception. mascara. giving birth. the boy camp throw chicken bones and art direct beer and octopus. our disco nap turned into a combat pass-out and at midnight we woke up to rejoin the stoics around the boom box. afrikaans people are not the only ones who know the true meaning of ‘kuier’. the next morning god must have been in the valley the weather was so good. the plastic lilo massiv’ chilled out in the dam with the type of hangovers only jack kareuac could truly describe. the hemel en aarde feels like it’s fast becoming the local. I’m still dreaming of owning a small cabin here. a typical day would be a surf in the morning at onrus (where you might get bumped by a shark) followed by rally driving gravel roads with an arcade fire overdub. pinot noir and mountains wait at the end of the valley for you as a type of reward.

  description: Mapping your system
---


## Let’s grab a coffee/beer/water. I’ll bring my notebook, questions and curiosity.  
We’ll map your system — not to fix it, but to *see* it.

You get a field journal, a 60-second video and one small step forward.  

**R2,800. No pressure. Just a good conversation.**

You’re not broken. You’re just stuck in a system you didn’t design.

Maybe it’s your business. Your job. Your creative project. Your daily routine.  
It’s not that you lack skills or hustle.  
It’s that the *system* you’re operating within is invisible, misaligned or quietly crushing you.

I help you see it. Not with jargon or sales flash.  
With a conversation. A sketch. A story.

## What Happens in Our Session?

This isn’t coaching. It’s **co-creation**.

1.  **The Diagram (The Landscape)**  
    We start with a simple question: *“If your system was a map, what would it look like?”*  
    I’ll sketch it live — not boxes and arrows, but hills, valleys, monsters, and hidden paths.  
    You’ll see your world in a whole new way.

2.  **The Questions (The Curiosity Engine)**  
    I’ve got a 20-question spreadsheet — not a quiz, but a set of gentle, revealing prompts:  
    - *What’s actually working? (The Terrain)*  
    - *What’s sucking you in? (The Quicksand)*  
    - *What are you avoiding? (The Hidden Path)*  
    - *What’s one small, doable thing to try next? (The Compass)*  
    We’ll pick 2–3 that make you laugh, wince, or exhale.

3.  **The Video (The Proof)**  
    After our coffee, I’ll send you a 60-second video — just me, talking to the camera, summarizing what we found.  
    It’s raw. It’s real. It’s proof you were seen.

4.  **The Deliverables (Your Toolkit)**  
    Within 24 hours, you’ll get:  
    - A **Field Journal (PDF)** — your system, mapped and named.  
    - A **60-Second Micro-Documentary (MP4)** — your “aha” moment, captured.  
    - Your **“Wedge”** — one small, absurd, doable action to start shifting things.

## Who Is This For?

- The **founder** who’s crushing it on paper but feels empty.
- The **creative** who’s viral on Instagram but feels like a fraud.
- The **executive** who’s climbing the ladder but hates the view.
- The **builder** who knows there’s a better way — they just can’t see it yet.

If you’re feeling the weight of the “Ant Hill,” this is your invitation to step outside it.

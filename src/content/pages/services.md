**Systems Creation & Navigation for the Awakened Builder**

I donâ€™t sell content.  
I design **leverage infrastructure** â€” for those who see the machine,  
and are ready to build their way out.

This is not creativity for attention.  
Itâ€™s **strategy made visible** â€” so you can own your life, not rent it.

## ðŸ”§ Core Offerings

### 1. **The Mythic Auditâ„¢**  
*One 90-minute session. One lever to pull. One system to shift.*  
R10,000 | $500

For founders, creatives, and high-agency individuals who feel stuck despite their skills.

Youâ€™ll get:
- Diagnosis of your current system
- Identification of your **wedge** (one small action with disproportionate returns)
- A clear next move â€” not theory, but action
- Access to tools, templates, and future opportunities

ðŸ‘‰ *This is not coaching. Itâ€™s architectural intervention.*

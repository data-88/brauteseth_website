### Architect of Systems, Stories and Myth

I don’t make content. I build infrastructure—for freedom, for ownership, for return. Born in Oslo Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, to a family of Norwegian settlers and builders, I learned early that creation is not ornamentation—it’s survival. At Rhodes University, I studied journalism to understand truth, philosophy to question power, computer science to decode systems, and linguistics to hear the silence between words. I shaped sound on campus radio as “HandyAndy,” then built brands, digital architectures and property empires across Dubai and South Africa—but I was never building for the machine. I was learning how to dismantle it from within. Every photograph I take, every line of code I write, every sentence I publish is an act of diagnosis: exposing the hidden weight of systems designed to consume people, not serve them.

I am not here to inspire you—I’m here to awaken. My art isn’t about beauty; it’s about revelation. When I bury ethernet cables in cement and call it “What We Forgot To Hold,” I’m not making sculpture—I’m memorializing the cost of connectivity. When I turn a CSV of breached passwords into poetry—“I was her birthday. I was his first kiss. Now I’m just another leak.”—I’m not writing verse, I’m giving voice to the stolen. I run Randpoint not as a cybersecurity firm, but as a sanctuary for small businesses crushed by corporate surveillance. I declined six-figure offers from banks because I refuse to be hired to clean up the messes of systems I helped expose. I don’t fix broken things—I rebuild them so they can never break again. This isn’t activism. It’s architecture. And I design with one rule: human dignity must be the foundation, not the afterthought.

I have fallen. I have been silent. I have been broken. But this is not a story of redemption—it’s a story of return. I no longer trade hours for money. I build leverage. My Field Notes are not blogs—they’re blueprints for those who see the machine and choose to walk away from it. Soon, I would like to open a private network—not for followers, but for architects: writers who think like engineers, photographers who code, builders who dream in protocols. This is how we escape the trap: not by shouting louder, but by designing a new world quietly, deliberately and without permission. I believe in data, yes—but only when it serves the soul. I believe in logic—but only when it bows to empathy. My vision? A South Africa where wealth is not hoarded, but architected. Where freedom is not earned through compliance but claimed through design. And if you’ve read this far—you already know.

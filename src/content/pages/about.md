### Architect of Systems, Stories and Myth

I don’t make content. I build infrastructure—for freedom, for ownership, for return. I grew up in Oslo Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, and went to school at Port Shepstone High, in a family shaped by Norwegian pioneers and builders. My path has never been conventional: I studied Journalism, Philosophy, and Linguistics at Rhodes University, later Computer Science at UNISA—mastering systems theory and programming while working nights as a DJ, photographer and code wrangler.

Across my life I’ve moved between disciplines and continents. I’ve photographed chicken farms in Sudan and desert villas in Dubai, DJ’d underground sets in the Middle East, wrote risk software at the South African Reserve Bank, and audited governments in Riyadh. I’ve built AI-driven tools for global telecoms, real-time dashboards during South Africa’s load-shedding chaos, and secure APIs for HSBC, Emirates Airlines, and Toyota. My cement sculptures—wired with decaying ethernet cables—now sit in Berlin collections, while my handmade book was sent to the King of Norway. I’ve traveled through countries, carrying my work, questions and systems with me.

What ties these projects together is not discipline but intent. I’ve never been interested in chasing trends or performing for algorithms. My focus is on building infrastructures—technical, artistic or social—that restore trust in an age where trust has been hollowed out. That’s why I founded Randpoint: not to sell firewalls, but to create security architectures that serve people, not just protocols. I don’t chase virality—I cultivate resonance. My work has been seen on CNN, French TV and in collections across continents but recognition was never the goal.

### Architect of Systems, Stories and Myth

I don’t make content. I build infrastructure—for freedom, for ownership, for return.

I was born in Oslo Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, into a family of Norwegian pioneers and builders—my lineage shaped by craftsmanship, resilience and stoic rebellion. At Rhodes University, I studied Journalism, Philosophy, and Linguistics; at UNISA, I pursued my Computer Science degree through rigorous self-discipline—mastering Linear Algebra, Programming Fundamentals, and Systems Theory while working nights as a DJ, photographer, and code wrangler. 

I became a polymath not by choice, but by necessity: to survive the contradictions of our digital age, I had to speak every language it spoke. I wrote poetry generators in Python that turned breached passwords into haunting verses. I mapped the entire PCI DSS data flow inside First National Bank—not for compliance but to understand where humanity got lost in the wires. I built a real-time Eskom Station Status dashboard during load-shedding chaos. I animated GIFs from Mac address traffic to visualise how devices silently track us. I designed AI-driven sentiment analysis tools for the Mobile World Congress. I made 500 commissioned photographic and video works—from chicken farms in Sudan to Dubai’s desert villas—and sent one handmade book to the King of Norway who replied with a thank you note. 

My work has been seen, heard and feared across continents—not because I chased fame, but because I refused to perform. I was featured on CNN as one of Cape Town’s top fashion photographers for my “Portrait of a Nation” series. French TV followed me as “Guy With Camera”—a lone figure documenting street life in Cape Town with no agenda but truth. I appeared on national television as Randpoint CEO, explaining cyber risk to a nation terrified of its own systems. I founded a video automating property marketing with AI-generated videos for real estate agents. I built Swim App in PHP to track junior swimmers’ progress. I created 40+ websites in Astro, Nuxt, Vue, and Next.js. I worked at a cybersecurity consulting firm (Wolfpack Information Risk) auditing 40+ JSE-listed companies. I red-teamed the Ministry of Investment Saudi Arabia. I wrote risk software for the South African Reserve Bank. I architected secure APIs for HSBC Middle East, Emirates Airlines and created awareness capmaigns for Toyota. I trained blue teams and I made a gold-plated AK-47 sculpture—not to glorify violence, but to question power. I painted like Frida Kahlo. I DJ’d underground sets in Dubai for 1,000 people under strobes fueled by Fjord Samplers. I taught children to swim, trained parrots to say “Captain!”, and drove excavators to build gated estates in KZN and Dubai. My cement sculptures—embedded with decaying ethernet cables—are now collected in Berlin. I even built a genealogy site tracing our Norwegian roots back to the early 1st century. This isn’t a resume. It’s a battlefield map.

I am not an influencer. I am an architect. I founded Randpoint after not to sell firewalls, but to rebuild trust. I’ve audited banks, governments, and telecom giants using FAIR, NIST, ISO, and PCI DSS frameworks. I’ve written cybersecurity textbooks for South African schools. I’ve led OSINT operations for Outsurance and SAA. I’ve modeled financial risk for the Middle East and designed anti-phishing campaigns for the British High Commission. I built a system to track Bree Street’s transformation from forgotten alleyway to cultural heartbeat—marketing it not with ads, but with human stories. I run Spotify playlists for my family. I edit abstract art films. I write in Markdown. I program in Go. I speak to machines so they’ll listen to humans. I’ve traveled 15 countries, survived scuba dives, raced Yamaha YZ80s with a kidney belt and learned to throw parties that become movements. I don’t chase virality—I cultivate resonance. When the Norwegians buy my art, it’s not because they like aesthetics. It’s because they recognize their ancestors in the silence between the pings.

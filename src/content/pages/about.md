### Architect of Systems, Stories and Myth

I don’t make content. I rebuild the foundations that content tries to hide. Born in Oslo Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, raised by Norwegian settlers who built with their hands and spoke little, I learned early that truth doesn’t need an audience — it needs integrity. I studied Journalism, Philosophy, and Linguistics at Rhodes University not to become a reporter or scholar but to understand how systems manipulate meaning. I taught myself Computer Science at UNISA — coding through the night, mastering algorithms, networks and systems theory — not for a degree, but to see behind the curtain of every firewall, database and algorithm that pretends to serve us while quietly consuming us.

I’ve mapped the PCI DSS data flows inside First National Bank like a surgeon dissecting a wound. I’ve built real-time Eskom load-shedding dashboards that kept communities alive. I’ve audited governments in Riyadh, secured APIs for Emirates and HSBC, trained blue teams at SKA Observatory, and written risk models for the South African Reserve Bank — all while photographing chicken farmers in Sudan, DJ’ing underground sets in Dubai under strobes fueled by Fjord Samplers and sculpting cement tombs embedded with decaying ethernet cables called “What We Forgot To Hold.” I sent a handmade book — poetry, photos, code — to the King of Norway and got a thank you note. 

I founded Randpoint Safety not to sell cybersecurity, but to restore dignity to it — protecting small businesses from corporate surveillance with architectures built on empathy, not fear. My work isn’t viral because I chase clicks; it’s seen because it resonates — a nurse in Durban recognizes her uncle in one photo; a mother in Israel finds peace in a GIF of server traffic; a curator in Berlin asks to display my cable sculpture because it feels like grief made visible. I am not a photographer, coder, CEO, or artist — I am the quiet force that turns infrastructure into conscience. You will battle to find much about me online. You won’t hear me pitch. But if you’ve ever felt unseen by the system, you already know my name.

## Work in Progress 

![Last Friday Shot](/last-friday.png)

*Four hours, one throne, zero apologies.*

---

I used to chase fashion weeks the way surfers chase stormsâ€”four-day shoots, ten looks, three cities.  
Then I shrank the circus into a **morning**.

---

### 10:00 am â€“ Cape Town, grey light  
Studio door opens.  
One model, one stylist, one make-up artist, and me with two cameras.  
The clock starts ticking **loud**.

---

### 10:12 am â€“ Sketches on the wall  
I draw the lighting plan on an iPad and throw it onto the white cyc like a battle map.  
The brand watches shadows become geometry.  
They realise this isnâ€™t a shootâ€”itâ€™s **live warfare with aesthetics**.

---

### 11:04 am â€“ First shutter  
Look one drops: silk against concrete, colour so clean it hums.  
I grade the RAW in real time on a tethered Resolve station.  
The client sees the hero before the model blinks.

---

### 12:17 pm â€“ Fabric in motion  
Look two turns into a 15-second slow-motion reelâ€”same camera, same LUT, same heartbeat.  
No second unit. No extra hours.  
Just **pure velocity**.

---

### 1:31 pm â€“ Final frame  
Look four lands.  
I hit export.  
The studio falls quiet.

---

### 2:00 pm â€“ Hand-off  
Twenty 8 K stills, three vertical reels, and the BTS footage leave the building before the coffee cups are cold.  
The brand walks out with an **entire campaign** in their pocket.

---

### After-sunset  
The sold-out screenshot becomes next monthâ€™s billboard.  
The price ticks up.  
Another brand starts the wait-list.

---

### The Rule  
The Last Friday happens **once a month**.  
One seat. One legend.  
When the clock hits two, the throne is **gone**.

# Norwegians in South Africa

## Introduction
Norwegians in South Africa are South African citizens of Norwegian ancestry[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). While most Norwegian emigrants moved to America, some people also moved to South Africa, Madagascar, Angola, and Mozambique[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). The number of Norwegians in the whole of Africa in 1920 was 998[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). The number rose to 1,107 by 1930; 651 Norwegians lived in South Africa and 147 in Madagascar[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans).

## History
In 1869, Arnt Leonard Thesen sailed to South Africa along with his large family in their schooner, the Albatros, after his ship-owning and timber company in Stavanger collapsed the previous year as a result of the Second Schleswig War of 1864-67[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). Even though they originally intended to go all the way to New Zealand, once they encountered stormy weather east of Cape Town after spending a week in Cape Town for repairs and to load provisions, they had to return to Cape Town for further repairs[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). Once there, they encountered the Swedish-Norwegian consul, Carl Gustaf Åkerberg, who notified them about transport shipping shortages along the South African coast and how they could take advantage of that situation; the plan to sail on to New Zealand was first delayed and then scrapped altogether[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). Ultimately, the Thesen family settled in Knysna, with its fjord-like port; their family firm first worked in timber shipping and then expanded to sawmills and acquiring forested land[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). Following Arnt Leonard’s death in 1875, ownership of the company was passed to one of his sons, Charles Wilhelm Thesen, and it expanded into additional ships and into other areas of work, such as oyster farming, whaling, hardware stores, and gold mining[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). Charles Wilhelm became more politically involved in Knysna, becoming its mayor in 1890-93 and again in 1921-24[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). The Thesen Company is still a major enterprise in South Africa to this day[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans).

## Settlements
Norwegian settlers primarily settled in the KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, and Western Cape regions[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). The Norwegian Settlers Church in Port Shepstone and the Norwegian Settlers Association of Marburg are notable communities that preserve the heritage and culture of Norwegian settlers[_{{{CITATION{{{_2{Norwegian Settlers Church](https://www.nsc.za.org/)[_{{{CITATION{{{_3{The Norwegian Settlers Association of Marburg, South Africa](http://www.norsettler.co.za/history.htm).

## Culture and Contributions
Norwegian South Africans have contributed significantly to various sectors, including agriculture, timber, and shipping[_{{{CITATION{{{_1{Norwegian South Africans - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans). They have also maintained their cultural heritage through community events, churches, and associations[_{{{CITATION{{{_2{Norwegian Settlers Church](https://www.nsc.za.org/)[_{{{CITATION{{{_3{The Norwegian Settlers Association of Marburg, South Africa](http://www.norsettler.co.za/history.htm).

## Conclusion
The legacy of Norwegian settlers in South Africa is a testament to their resilience and adaptability. Their contributions to the country's development and cultural diversity continue to be remembered and celebrated.

# Norwegians on the Natal South Coast: The Legacy of the Norwegian Settlers and the Brauteseth Family

## Introduction

The story of the Norwegian settlers on the South Coast of Natal—now **KwaZulu-Natal**, South Africa—is a remarkable chapter in the history of European migration to Africa. While the majority of Norwegians emigrated to the United States, a smaller, intrepid group ventured southward, founding a unique community near **Port Shepstone** in a village called **Marburg**. At the heart of this community was the **Norwegian Settlers Church** ([NSC](https://www.nsc.za.org/)) and among its key families was the **Brauteseth family**.

From the original settler **O.J. Brauteseth**, to his descendant **Nils Brauteseth**, who founded the **Genesis Foundation**, and his son **Ken Brauteseth**, who helped build what became known as **“The Middle Church”**, the Brauteseths helped shape the spiritual and cultural infrastructure of the region for generations.

## Norwegian Immigration to Natal

Norwegian migration to South Africa began in earnest in the late 19th century. Although fewer than 1,000 Norwegians lived across all of Africa by 1920—of which **651 were in South Africa**—they formed tight-knit communities with long-lasting influence ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_South_Africans)).

A pivotal figure in this migration was **Captain Landmark**, a Norwegian missionary and shipmaster who explored **Natal** and **Zululand** and wrote compelling brochures praising the region’s climate and fertile land. His vision inspired a formal colonization scheme launched in **1880**.

On **29 August 1882**, a group of **34 Norwegian families**, totaling **229 individuals**, arrived by ship from **Aalesund** at the mouth of the **Umzimkulu River**. Each family received a **100-acre farm**, and one plot was set aside specifically for a church.

This community became **Marburg**, named after the German town of the same name, and quickly took root.

## Founding of the Norwegian Settlers Church

From the very beginning, the **Norwegian Settlers Church** served as the heart of the community. On the first Sunday after arriving, **Reverend Emil Berg** held a worship service on **Lot 17**, which later became the official church site.

- The first church was built from **mud bricks** and completed by the settlers’ first anniversary in **1883**.
- A **school hall** was added in **1886**, reflecting the importance of education in the community.
- In **1997**, a new sanctuary seating 800 people was constructed.
- By **2008**, a **2,500-seater “battleship-style” church** was built to support the growing congregation and its outreach programs.

Today, the church remains an active and modern Christian institution, and its attached museum preserves Norwegian cultural artifacts such as **bunads**, household tools, and utensils brought from Norway ([NSC History](https://www.nsc.za.org/)).

## The Brauteseth Family's Early Legacy

Among the first group of Norwegian settlers in **1882** was **Otto Johannes (O.J.) Brauteseth**. After a year in Marburg, O.J. moved to **Eshowe**, where he worked as a builder. It was here that he met **Johanne**, a housekeeper working in **Kearsney**. They married in **1891** at the Eshowe church and eventually returned to Marburg, taking over **Lot 11**.

Together, they had four children—**Ole**, **Kristian**, and two others. By **1997**, the Brauteseth family had grown to over **360 descendants** in South Africa.

O.J. was actively involved in the **Ladies' Aid Society**, which was foundational in the formation of what is now the **Norwegian Settlers Church**. The Brauteseth home region in Norway was **Ørsta**, and the original family homestead there is now a **small museum** that honours the family’s heritage.

Photographs of O.J. and his descendants appear in the commemorative book *The Norwegian Settlers – Marburg, Natal 1882* (published in 1932 by Anna and Andrew Halland and Ingeborg Kjonstad), a treasured record of the settlers' legacy.

## Nils and Ken Brauteseth: Building for the Future

### Nils Brauteseth and the Genesis Foundation

In the 20th century, **Nils Brauteseth**, a descendant of O.J., carried forward the family’s spiritual and community-building mission by founding the **Genesis Foundation**. The Foundation focused on **social development, outreach, and holistic support** for vulnerable members of the Port Shepstone community. It served as an extension of the original values brought from Norway—faith, service, and practical compassion.

### Ken Brauteseth and the Middle Church

Nils’ son, **Ken Brauteseth**, played a key role in the construction of the **“Middle Church”**, the second sanctuary building used by the NSC between the early mud-brick church and the modern 2,500-seater auditorium. This intermediate building reflected the growth of the church and served the congregation during a critical time of expansion in the late 20th century.

Ken’s contribution to the church’s infrastructure echoed the pioneering spirit of his ancestors while meeting the needs of a new generation of worshippers.

## Cultural Legacy and Community Impact

The cultural legacy of the Norwegian settlers can still be seen across the South Coast:

- Place names like **Oslo Beach**, **Fredheim**, and **Marburg** reflect their heritage.
- Traditional Norwegian holidays such as **Syttende Mai** (Constitution Day) are still celebrated locally, often with children participating in **potetløp** (potato races) in full costume.
- The **Norwegian Settlers Church Museum** remains a living testament to the courage, resilience, and faith of the original families.

## Conclusion

The history of the **Norwegian settlers in Natal** is a story of determination, faith, and cultural continuity. From the 1882 arrival of the original 34 families to the modern ministries of the **Genesis Foundation**, the influence of Norwegian South Africans remains deeply embedded in the region.

The **Brauteseth family**, through generations of commitment—from **O.J.** to **Nils** to **Ken**—has stood as a cornerstone of this legacy. Their contributions to spiritual life, community development, and cultural heritage continue to inspire, preserving a unique identity forged across oceans and generations.

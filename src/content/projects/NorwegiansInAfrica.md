## 1882 Arrival in Marburg: Otto Johannes “O.J.” Brauteseth

On **29 August 1882**, the Norwegian barque *Lapland* landed at the **Umzimkulu River**, carrying **34 families (229 people)** to Natal’s South Coast. These settlers founded **Marburg**, each granted 100 acres and drawn together by farming and faith.

One of the earliest settlers was **Otto Johannes “O.J.” Brauteseth**, who took up land on **Lot 11** after marrying **Johanne Øye** in 1891. They raised four children and fostered a lineage that numbered over **360 known descendants by 1997**. O.J. was a founding member of the Ladies’ Aid Society of the Norwegian Settlers Church—their story appears in the 1932 jubilee memorial book alongside photos and oral histories.

## The First Generation: Expanding Family Roots

Key family connections:

- **Ole Brauteseth** married Elizabeth Viljoen; children: John and Kathleen.
- **Kristian Brauteseth** married Ruth Larsen; their sons included Ernst, Ludwig, Rolf, Viktor, Nils, Ronald, Trygvar, and Arne.
- **Otine Brauteseth** married Clarence Riggen; children: Doris, Leonard, Clarice, and Enid.
- **Otto Jr. Brauteseth** married Inga Sivertson; children: Arthur and Bernhard.

This growth helped solidify the family’s presence across Port Shepstone and surrounding areas, with descendants playing roles in agriculture, faith, and community life.

## Third Generation: Nils and the Genesis Foundation

A notable leader from the next generation was **Nils Brauteseth**, son of Kristian. Passionate about community outreach, he founded the **Genesis Foundation**, also referred to as the Genesis Trust.

The organization partners with the Norwegian Settlers Church to address:
- HIV/AIDS care and prevention
- Youth mentorship and vocational training
- Women’s empowerment and trauma support
- Food security initiatives

The annual **Landingsfest**—held every **29 August**—commemorates the 1882 arrival, bringing together local families and Norwegian heritage visitors in celebration of culture and service.

## Ken Brauteseth: The Middle Church Builder

**Ken Brauteseth**, son of Nils, led a pivotal building phase: the construction of the **“Middle Church”**, a sanctuary used from mid-20th century until the new auditorium was constructed in 1997–2008.

Ken oversaw both design and grassroots labor, ensuring the building functioned as both a spiritual and community center. This manifested the family’s ongoing narrative of “building stones and souls.”

## Later Generations: Diversified Impact

### Entrepreneurial Leadership — Clive Brauteseth

**Clive Brauteseth**, grandson of Kristian, has played a major role in transforming **Brauteseth Blasting** into a leading mining service across Southern Africa. With expansion into multiple provinces and neighboring nations, the company employs advanced heavy machinery and supports infrastructure projects—showing the family’s shift into industrial enterprise.

### Political Service — Tim Brauteseth

**Timothy James Brauteseth**, a public servant for the **Democratic Alliance**, served as a Member of Parliament (2014–2019) and now represents KwaZulu-Natal in the **National Council of Provinces (NCOP)**. His work focuses on transparency and accountability—particularly in oversight committees like **SCOPA**—and he draws on his legal and financial background to champion good governance.

### Faith Leaders — Shaun & Trigvor Brauteseth

Carrying forward the spiritual heritage, both **Shaun** and **Trigvor Brauteseth** serve as pastors in regional congregations. Their ministries emphasize mentorship, outreach, and community resilience—continuing the multi-generational tradition of faith-led social engagement.

### Creative Artist — Romy Brauteseth

Bringing artistic flair to the legacy is **Romy Brauteseth**, a jazz bassist from Port Elizabeth, born in 1989. Educated at UCT, she’s toured internationally and released the album **Neo Native** in 2018. Her music keeps the Brauteseth name vibrant within South Africa’s cultural scene.

## The Enduring Legacy: Faith, Family, and Service

Across six generations, the Brauteseth family has consistently embodied their founding values through:

- Building farms, homes, and churches
- Establishing community programs via Genesis Trust
- Providing infrastructure and employment through business
- Serving citizens and championing ethics in politics
- Leading congregations and nurturing spirituality
- Inspiring creativity and culture through art

This legacy reinforces how one family’s faith, courage, and service can echo across history—feeding not just descendants but entire communities.

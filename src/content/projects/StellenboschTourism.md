when I think of stellenbosch I think of wine estate vistas, big oaked chardonnays, herds of bmw GS1200â€™s and students. lots of students. and it is some of things but when mariette from destinate asked me to shoot the stellenbosch vibe for their winter campaign it was a bit of an eye opener. streams of international students biking and stating through campus in the morning makes it feel like a mini-copenhagen. nearly the locals get into their morning coffee rituals at schoon de companje bakery. projects like kom-sit create art happening on street corners and we stumbled into a few beautiful galleries hiding in dutch heritage architecture. in the evenings the wine bars like brampton are humming and beer spots like the new craft tapas offer dozens of local brews on tap. we did an incredible morning hike up to a hidden waterfall in the jonkershoek mountains (my kind of hike where you drive and then walk for 30 mins) and strolled through the kayamandi community which offered a very different take usual stellenbosch narrative.

## Pictures comming soon

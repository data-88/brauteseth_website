Wanted magazine is Business Day’s lifestyle supplement. It’s a hugely successful local luxury market magazine modeled in some ways after the London based Financial Times’ ‘How to Spend it’. It’s filled with insightful, witty, premium lifestyle journalism.

In each of my fashion shoots I aim to do something very new and dramatic whether it’s shooting underwater (take a look at the Beauty & Water shoot) or something very edgy and fashion forward like ‘Man Made Moon’. For this shoot I wanted it to be bold but almost more commercial, which means shooting in a style that could actually resemble a final ad campaign for one of brands. I chose a story that explored the relationship between architecture and the structure and design of men’s formal wear. I was playing with ideas around a famous Coco Chanel quote, “Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.” My aim was to interpret these ideas visually through uses of dramatic lighting, hard shadows, strong lines, perspectives and silhouettes while always keeping the focus on the quality and tailoring of the garments themselves.

Some of the brands we shot included Fabiani, Daniele Alessandrini (available at Speagetti Mafia), Paul Smith, Viyella, Tiger of Sweden (available at Melrose Arch), Louis Vuitton (which we flew in from Paris as few days before the shoot), Hugo Hugo Boss, Boss Hugo Boss, Trenery, C2 and Burberry (also flown in from London).

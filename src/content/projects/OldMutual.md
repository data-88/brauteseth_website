Cape Town-based advertising agency **Radar** has recently joined forces with the global Publicis-owned **Leo Burnett**, marking a strategic move to boost their profile and presence both locally and internationally. Radar has built a strong reputation for delivering creative and impactful campaigns, serving a diverse range of clients from their base at 21 Rose Street, Cape Town.

I had the privilege of working alongside Radar on the **Old Mutual "Connecta"** stills campaign. This collaboration highlighted Radar’s ability to combine strategic insight with creative execution, producing visuals that resonated deeply with the target audience and elevated the product’s brand presence.

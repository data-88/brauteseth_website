HAAS was founded by Glynn Venter on the model of a ‘collective’; an agency working along side a a design gallery, concept store and coffee house in the Bo-Kaap. They wanted to develop a creative hub that would attract creative talent and also facilitate interesting collaborations and conversations, all with a little help from their own amazing single origin coffee. HAAS have achieved their aim of being one of the best coffee and conversation destinations in the country and while frequenting their Bo-Kaap coffee shop I met Glynn and we started conversations on developing a new visual style for the V&A Waterfront.

This lifestyle shoot at the V&A Waterfront beautifully captures the juxtaposition between Cape Town’s rich heritage and its evolving modern identity. The concept emerged during visits to HAAS in District Six, a creative hub founded by Glynn Venter. HAAS—initially centered in the Bo-Kaap—has evolved into a collective model encompassing a design gallery, concept store, café, and cultural space powered by exceptional single origin coffee.

After connecting with Glynn over coffee at the District Six location, the idea to reimagine the visual identity of the V&A Waterfront took shape. The shoot visualizes that narrative: historic architecture, cobbled lanes, and ocean views intersecting with sleek, contemporary styling. The final images highlight the meeting point of tradition and innovation—infusing classic Cape Town heritage with modern aesthetic energy at one of South Africa’s most iconic destinations.

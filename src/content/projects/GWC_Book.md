After the GWC blog was a success, I printed a book featuring a wide scope of writing and photographic work. The journal is a â€œzeitgeisticial-gestalt snapshot of Cape Town culture". Images focus upon a number of passions, including Cape Town, digital culture, advertising books, motorbikes and life on the internet.

### I sold all the copies but there might be something available by order or by Clarkes Bookshop in Cape Town.

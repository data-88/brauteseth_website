Although I’ve been friends with the Cape Town legend Paul van der Spuy for years, we’ve only recently started working together on ideas for his brand. Since he’s such an hugely creative guy and power-instagrammer (I don’t think there’s a any part of P&G that he hasn’t instagrammed yet) we’ve been bouncing around hundreds of ideas we could possibly shoot. Put him on a bike! Get him to carry hessian coffee sacks through bot river! Put a strelitzia on him! Eventually I convinced Paul to start with something simple that we could shoot in Heaven, my studio. We asked Kristian and Christie to help us out. They’re both great local faces from the Cape Town scene at the moment. Although I’ve been working with portraits for years, part of my psychology has been to continually push productions, push lensing, push lighting, push locations. I.e. if it’s too easy it can’t be good. But there’s something so beautiful and pure about one-light studio portraits. Using a big 5-foot softbox really creates this clean look and draws out the character of the person. There’s no distractions with backgrounds and very powerful in it’s simplicity. We shot some of his amazing industrial shirts, wolf tees and the crisp white classics. There’s a lot more work in the pipeline.

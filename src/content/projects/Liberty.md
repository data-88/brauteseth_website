A lot has been going on. I’m working on something that’s quite a radical departure from anything I’ve done before. I’ve been wanting to start this project for ages. Well, ever since I returned from Buenos Aires last year after seeing an Alberto Passolini painting at MALBA. It’s a long story, but that’s the moment the jigsaw pieces started fitting together. Like mental Tetris. I can’t say much more about it right now. Well, except that the work raises questions about Liberty. I’ve made this short video as a teaser.
